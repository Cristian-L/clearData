Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
CodeBook.md - describes variables, data, and code used to save, merge, clean and resave the data as a new file.

run_analysis.R inlcudes the code and comments to achieve the file download and unpack and desired outcome (5 requirements):

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the final data saved after the process described above.
